# Airtable Tools
Airtable scripts and tools for analyzing YouTube videos and more. My goal is to make it easier to mangle small datasets within Airtable.

## License
MIT permissive license, have fun. If you do something cool, show me! If you appreciate the work, feel free to link back to this repo so others can benefit.

## Requirements
- Airtable: paid account with access to the Extensions feature
- YouTube v3 API: from Google Cloud Platform
- OpenAI API: an account with access to OpenAI Playground

## List of scripts
1. Search YouTube for topic and return video URLs to Airtable
2. Import YouTube stats and thumbnails for videos
3. Import YouTube channel stats including subscriber count and thumbnail
4. Shorten video titles and un-clickbait them via OpenAI. This helps make galleries look prettier in Airtable if you want the video title to be the primary field of a table.
